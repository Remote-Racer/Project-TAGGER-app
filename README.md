## Proof-of-Concept Application for Real-Time Gaming with Remote Hardware
Project TAGGER is a project developed for the capstone project for CSCE 483 in the Fall of 2024 in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M. The project was developed to create a proof-of-concept got integrating live hardware into a gaming application by developing a control system for purpose-built RC vehicles to be operated by clients via a web application handling user management and game logic. This repository contains the source code for the application of the project, developed in the NodeJS framework with ExpressJS for dynamic content.

## Capable of Being Operated from Anywhere
The application is designed to hande clients from anywhere around the world via a remote server host to manage the delivery of control inputs to the hardware and the subsequent responses for individual clients. The application can also be run through a local deployment for testing purposes and decreased latency provided all users and hardware are operating on the same network.

## Expandable Design
The project has been future-proofed to handle an expanded scale from the initial design scope. The software was tested utilizing two vehicles, but the implementation of lobby systems and user management provides room for the project to be scaled up to handle a greater volume of users, further facilitated through the modular and easily replicable design implemented for the hardware systems.
